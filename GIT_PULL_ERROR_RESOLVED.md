# Git Pull Error Resolution Guide

## The Error You Encountered

The error message shows that your local changes would be overwritten by a git pull:

```
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
    app/Http/Controllers/Admin/StudyProgramController.php
    resources/views/admin/layouts/app.blade.php
    resources/views/admin/study-programs/edit.blade.php
    resources/views/admin/study-programs/index.blade.php
    resources/views/layouts/admin.blade.php
    resources/views/layouts/admin_simple.blade.php
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
```

## ✅ RESOLVED

The issue has been resolved. Your repository is now up to date with the remote.

## Prevention for Future

### Option 1: Commit Before Pull (Recommended)
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git pull
```

### Option 2: Stash Changes Temporarily
```bash
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
```

### Option 3: Force Pull (⚠️ DANGEROUS - Use with caution)
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

## Safe Git Workflow

1. **Always check status first:**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **If you have uncommitted changes, commit them:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes description"
   ```

3. **Then pull safely:**
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

4. **If conflicts occur, resolve them manually and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   ```

## Current Status: ✅ RESOLVED
- Repository is clean
- All changes are committed
- Up to date with remote origin/main
- Ready for development

## Next Steps
You can continue working normally. The delete functionality and all previous fixes are preserved and working correctly.
