# Study Program Edit Functionality - Fix Complete âœ…

## Summary
Successfully fixed the edit study program functionality with comprehensive updates to match the StudyProgram model structure.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Field Mismatch Issues
- **Problem**: Form was using `degree_level` field, but model expects `degree`
- **Solution**: Updated form to use correct `degree` field with proper options (D3, S1, S2, S3)

### 2. Missing Database Columns
- **Problem**: Model had `curriculum`, `website`, `phone` in fillable but columns didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created migration to add missing columns to study_programs table

### 3. Incomplete Form Fields
- **Problem**: Edit form was missing many fields that exist in the model
- **Solution**: Added all missing form fields:
  - `curriculum` - Text area for curriculum information
  - `facilities` - Text area for facilities (array handling)
  - `website` - URL input with validation
  - `email` - Email input with validation
  - `phone` - Text input for phone number
  - `head_of_program` - Text input for program head
  - `credit_total` - Number input for total credits (SKS)
  - `semester_total` - Number input for total semesters
  - `accreditation_year` - Number input for accreditation year

### 4. Invalid Fields Removed
- **Problem**: Form had fields that don't exist in model (`image`, `duration`, `tuition_fee`)
- **Solution**: Removed non-existent fields from edit form

### 5. Controller Validation Issues
- **Problem**: Controller validation and update logic didn't handle all model fields
- **Solution**: Updated StudyProgramController with:
  - Complete validation rules for all fields
  - Proper array conversion for `career_prospects` and `facilities`
  - Updated store() and update() methods to handle all fields

## Files Modified

### 1. Database Migration
- `database/migrations/2025_08_26_120000_add_missing_study_program_fields.php`
  - Added `curriculum`, `website`, `phone` columns

### 2. View Template
- `resources/views/admin/study-programs/edit.blade.php`
  - Fixed field name: `degree_level` â†’ `degree`
  - Added all missing form fields with proper validation display
  - Removed non-existent fields (image, duration, tuition_fee)
  - Maintained proper form layout and JavaScript functionality

### 3. Controller
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/StudyProgramController.php`
  - Updated validation rules for all fields
  - Enhanced store() method with complete field handling
  - Enhanced update() method with complete field handling
  - Proper array conversion for career_prospects and facilities

## Testing Results

### âœ… Database Level Testing
- All fields can be updated successfully
- Array fields (career_prospects, facilities) properly converted and stored
